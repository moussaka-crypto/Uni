    "To conclude this notebook, several approaches for text processing with [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) and [TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer) have been tested and analyzed. <br> <br>\n",
    "After having created a **bag of words** with `CountVectorizer`, some interesting features were determined, as follows:\n",
    "* total number of *different words* \n",
    "* total number of *words per document*\n",
    "* the number of *occurrences for each word* (represented as a dictionary data structure)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a viable way to satisfy more advanced filtering criteria is utilizing both `CountVectorizer` and a `pandas` dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using some parameters like *max_df/min_df, stop_words and ngram_range* to clean the dataset from trivial words and still keep the relevant information in tact was an important part of this lab work as well, as referenced in *point 3*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the use of `TfidfVectorizer` with the aforementioned parameters has been used to weigh specific terms from the dataset. This approach allows for the creation of a matrix where each entry represents the *tf-idf score* of a term, emphasizing their importance, while considering their rarity across the entire corpus. Conclusively, the normalization of the matrix with the L2 norm helps optimization, as well as keeping activations on similar levels."
