### Uni projects and other learning materials, referring to the modules I have had at FH Aachen studying Computer Science
* #### _ads_ (Algorithms and Data Structures)
    * Doubly Linked List implementation and use case for a Twitter Console App
    * Types of Graphs and basic Graph traversal Algorithms (Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal, DFS, BFS) implementation
    * Red Black Tree implementation
    * Ring buffer and a Binary Search Tree implementation
    * Implementation of Sorting and Hashing algorithms with a plot referring to runtime complexity

* #### _dnis_ (Networking and IT-Security)
    * Project 3 is solely a TCP Reno package calculation
    * Project 4 is the design of a network architecture demo in Packet Tracer with a subnetting table included
    * Final Project is the design of an intercity network architecture together with the required documentation and subnetting tables
 
* #### _gip_ (Programming Basics)
    * Projects due every week to learn and implement certain programming concepts in C++ (_Praktikum_)
    * Programming exercises, 80% of which were mandatory to attend the exam (_Jenkins_)
 
* #### _m2_ (Advanced Mathematics 2) - a collection of programming assignments in Calculus, Linear Algebra and Statistics
    * Euler and Heun methods for finding numerical solutions of differential equations
    * Fourier forward and backward Transformation
    * Gradient Method with adaptive step sizes
    * Monte Carlo Simulation of a lottery
    * Newtons's method
